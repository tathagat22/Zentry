#Project: Zentry-Inspired Website (Replica)

Overview:
---------
This project is a front-end replica inspired by the design, motion, and interaction experience of Zentry and other award-winning websites featured on platforms like Awwwards, FWA, and CSS Design Awards.

It is developed purely for educational, experimental, and portfolio purposes to study modern web design trends, animation workflows (GSAP/Framer Motion), and immersive UI/UX storytelling.

Technologies Used:
------------------
- React.js (Vite or Next.js structure)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for interactive motion
- Custom SVG clip paths and layered image masking
- Video backgrounds with subtle blend effects
- Responsive grid and flex layouts
- Font & typographic art with special classes
